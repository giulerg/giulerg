# 🚀 Data Science Journey: From Trainee to Expert

Welcome to my corner of the internet! 👋 Here, you'll find a collection of my projects as I embark on my Data Science and Machine Learning journey. I’m currently a Data Science enthusiast, learning, experimenting, and building practical solutions to real-world problems. 

📍 **Location:** Ankara, Turkey  
🔗 **GitHub:** [giulerg](https://github.com/giulerg)

## 🎯 What’s Inside

I’m diving deep into the world of data, exploring models, algorithms, and analysis techniques. Here's a glimpse of what you’ll find in this repository:

- **📊 Data Analysis:** Turning raw data into actionable insights.
- **🔍 Machine Learning Models:** Building models that can predict, classify, and optimize.
- **📈 Visualizations:** Creating interactive charts that tell the story of the data.

Here are a few examples of what I've worked on:

### 🔍 [Exploring Titanic Dataset - Data Cleaning & Visualization](https://github.com/giulerg/project1)
- Analyzing passenger data from the Titanic disaster.
- Data cleaning, feature engineering, and insightful visualizations.

### 🚀 [Predicting House Prices with Regression Models](https://github.com/giulerg/project2)
- Applied linear and ridge regression to predict housing prices.
- Optimized models and evaluated performance.

### 🤖 [Building My First Machine Learning Model: A Classification Task](https://github.com/giulerg/project3)
- Using classification algorithms to predict whether a customer will purchase a product based on historical data.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

I’ve been experimenting with a variety of tools and libraries to build my projects:

- **Languages:** Python 🐍
